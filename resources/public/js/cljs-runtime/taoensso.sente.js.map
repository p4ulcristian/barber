May have semantic meaning (e.g. username, email address),\n                  may not (e.g. client/random id) - app's discretion.\n    * cb        - Callback\n    * tout      - Timeout\n    * ws        - WebSocket/s\n    * pstr      - Packed string. Arbitrary Clojure data serialized as a\n                  string (e.g. edn) for client<->server comms\n    * udt       - Unix timestamp (datetime long)\n\n  Special messages:\n    * Callback wrapping: [<clj> <?cb-uuid>] for [1], [2]\n    * Callback replies: :chsk/closed, :chsk/timeout, :chsk/error\n\n    * Client-side events:\n        [:chsk/handshake [<?uid> nil[4] <?handshake-data> <first-handshake?>]]\n        [:chsk/state [<old-state-map> <new-state-map>]]\n        [:chsk/recv <ev-as-pushed-from-server>] ; Server>user push\n        [:chsk/ws-ping]\n\n    * Server-side events:\n        [:chsk/bad-package <packed-str>]\n        [:chsk/bad-event   <event>]\n        [:chsk/uidport-open  <uid>]\n        [:chsk/uidport-close <uid>]\n        [:chsk/ws-ping]\n\n  Channel socket state map:\n    :type               - e/o #{:auto :ws :ajax}\n    :open?              - Truthy iff chsk appears to be open (connected) now\n    :ever-opened?       - Truthy iff chsk handshake has ever completed successfully\n    :first-open?        - Truthy iff chsk just completed first successful handshake\n    :uid                - User id provided by server on handshake,    or nil\n    :handshake-data     - Arb user data provided by server on handshake\n    :last-ws-error      - ?{:udt _ :ev <WebSocket-on-error-event>}\n    :last-ws-close      - ?{:udt _ :ev <WebSocket-on-close-event>\n                            :clean? _ :code _ :reason _}\n    :last-close         - ?{:udt _ :reason _}, with reason e/o\n                            #{nil :requested-disconnect :requested-reconnect\n                             :downgrading-ws-to-ajax :unexpected}\n    :udt-next-reconnect - Approximate udt of next scheduled auto-reconnect attempt\n\n  Notable implementation details:\n    * core.async is used liberally where brute-force core.async allows for\n      significant implementation simplifications. We lean on core.async's\n      efficiency here.\n    * For WebSocket fallback we use long-polling rather than HTTP 1.1 streaming\n      (chunked transfer encoding). Http-kit _does_ support chunked transfer\n      encoding but a small minority of browsers &/or proxies do not. Instead of\n      implementing all 3 modes (WebSockets, streaming, long-polling) - it seemed\n      reasonable to focus on the two extremes (performance + compatibility).\n      In any case client support for WebSockets is growing rapidly so fallback\n      modes will become increasingly irrelevant while the extra simplicity will\n      continue to pay dividends.\n\n  General-use notes:\n    * Single HTTP req+session persists over entire chsk session but cannot\n      modify sessions! Use standard a/sync HTTP Ring req/resp for logins, etc.\n    * Easy to wrap standard HTTP Ring resps for transport over chsks. Prefer\n      this approach to modifying handlers (better portability).\n\n  [4] Used to be a csrf-token.
